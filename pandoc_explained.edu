pandoc is installed on this system and is the goto tool for file convertions. 
Here is a good wrap up of how to use it.

To see all formats and pandoc documentation go to :https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#options
You can also use this command for output formats: --list-output-formats
And this for supported raw file types: -list-extensions


USE THIS SIMPLE SYNTAX: pandoc -t FORMAT --to=FORMAT -o OUTPUTFILE
