One good reason to use markup language often in README files (like README.md) is that it is very easy to convert to other file formats as opose to plain rich text format.
Sites like GitHub, Bitbucket, Reddit, Diaspora, Stack Exchange, OpenStreetMap, and SourceForge use variants of Markdown to facilitate discussion between users.

markdown_example.md is an example where you see various "language markdown code" and corresponding a markdown_example.html that show the result when it is converted to HTML.
